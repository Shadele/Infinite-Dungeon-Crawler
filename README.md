# Infinite-Dungeon-Crawler
 A randomly generated text based dungeon crawler
 This dungeon crawler has a leveling system, custom death/ending messages, a rudimentary combat system, and randomly generated enemies.

 The objective is to obtain the Amulet of Serpents. Each monster has a 1/100 (so 1%) chance to spawn with the amulet in their inventory. Defeat the monster that has it and you'll win the game!

 Eventually, there will be starting equipment, racial options (human, elf, orc, etc), class options (fighter, archer, wizard, etc.) and random events generated as well (shops, special monsters, and so on).
